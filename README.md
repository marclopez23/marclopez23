I'm a Technology and Motorsports geek who loves to create all kinds of interactive products that help people to have an easier and better life experience.

I think my perseverance has led me to try to always be learning new things. Also, I could say that study is one of my passions. This led me to go through the world of audiovisuals, design, and now I'm focused on improving my skills in web development.

Although it may seem strange, working on intense and complicated projects is how I enjoy the most, but that's one of the advantages of being a very patient and motivated person. ðŸ˜‰
